          <p>
            Founded in 2008, we have a proud history of providing compassionate
            and comprehensive mental health services. We started with a small
            team of dedicated professionals, eager to change lives through our
            expertise in mental health care. Over the years, our center has
            grown to accommodate an expanding community, staying committed to
            our original vision of creating a safe space for healing. Today, we
            are a multidisciplinary team, continually building on our strong
            foundation and innovating in response to the changing needs of our
            patients.
